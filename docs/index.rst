Introduction to running R, Python, and Julia in HPC
==============================================================

.. admonition:: Content

   - This course aims to give a brief, but comprehensive introduction to using Python, Julia and R in an HPC environment.
   - You will learn how to
      - start the interpreters of Python, Julia and R by the HPC module system
      - find site installed packages/libraries
      - install packages/libraries yourself
      - use virtual environments
      - use the calculation nodes
        - write batch scripts 
        - work interactivly

   - This course will consist of lectures interspersed with hands-on sessions where you get to try out what you have just learned.    


.. admonition:: Cluster-specific approaches

   - The course is a cooperation between UPPMAX (Rackham, Snowy, Bianca) and HPC2N (Kebnekaise) and will focus on the compute systems at both centres.
   - Although there are differences we will this time not have seperate sessions.

Some practicals
---------------

.. admonition:: Earlier courses 

   - HPC-Python: https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python
  
     - Q/A are public at the HackMD pages
  
       - https://hackmd.io/@bclaremar/HPC-python
       - https://hackmd.io/IoseeprATrWH0ZI7z6wJ-w?view
  
   - R: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/events/courses/2022/R-in-HPC
   
 
.. admonition:: Zoom

    - The course is run over Zoom. You should have gotten an email with the links
        
    - There will be a zoom for the lectures
   
    - When you join the Zoom meeting, use your REAL NAME.
    
    - The lectures and demos will be recorded, but NOT the exercises. 
    
      - If you ask questions during the lectures, you may thus be recorded. 
      - If you do not wish to be recorded, then please keep your microphone muted and your camera off during lectures and write your questions in the Q/A document (see below about Microsoft-365 collaboration document).
    
    - Please MUTE your microphone when you are not speaking and use the ???Raise hand??? functionality under the ???Participants??? window during the lecture. Please do not clutter the Zoom chat. Behave politely!

    - There will be breakout rooms used in the Zoom for the exercises. 
    
      - You may enter there and you will get personal help
      
    
.. admonition:: Collaboration document (Microsoft-365)

    - `Q/A collaboration document <https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/HPC2N630/EbHWglWYU_VNpTpdD2CtSfYBlpsAF6DyD_4RMwWCie_B0g?rtime=uSWfqzII20g>`_
    
    - Use this page for the workshop with your questions.

    - Depending on how many helpers there are we'll see how fast there are answers. 
        - Some answers may come after the workshop day.
        
.. hint::

   - Project ID: naiss2023-22-44 

   - Directory name on rackham: /proj/py-r-jl 

   - Please create a suitably named subdirectory below /proj/py-r-jl, for your own exercises.

Prepare your environment now!
-----------------------------
  
- Please log in to Rackham, Kebnekaise or other cluster that you are using.

.. admonition:: Use Thinlinc or terminal?

   - It is up to you!
   - Graphics come easier with Thinlinc
   - For this course, when having many windows open, it may be better to run in terminal, for screen space issues.


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UPPMAX

      1. Log in to Rackham!
        - Terminal: ``ssh -Y <user>@rackham.uppmax.uu.se`` 
      
        - ThinLinc app: ``<user>@rackham-gui.uppmax.uu.se``
        - ThinLinc in web browser: https://rackham-gui.uppmax.uu.se
      
      2. If not already: create a working directory where you can code along.
         - We recommend creating it under the course project storage directory
   
      3. Example. If your username is "mrspock" and you are at UPPMAX, this we recommend you create this folder: 
     
         .. code-block:: sh
         
            $ mkdir /proj/py-r-jl/mrspock/<language>

   .. tab:: HPC2N

      - Kebnekaise through terminal: ``<user>@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se``     
      - Kebnekaise through ThinLinc, use: ``<user>@kebnekaise-tl.hpc2n.umu.se``
   
      - Create a working directory where you can code along.    
      
        - Example. If your username is bbrydsoe and you are at HPC2N, then we recommend you create this folder: 
     
           /proj/nobackup/<your-project-id>/bbrydsoe/<language> 
         
   
The two HPC centers UPPMAX and HPC2N
------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Two HPC centers

   - There are many similarities:
   
     - Login vs. calculation/compute nodes
     - Environmental module system with software hidden until loaded with ``module load``
     - Slurm batch job and scheduling system
     - ``pip install`` procedure
     
   - ... and small differences:
   
     - commands to load Python, Python packages, R, Julia
     - isolated environments ``virtualenv`` vs ``venv``
     - slightly different flags to Slurm
     
   - ... and some bigger differences:
   
     - UPPMAX has three different clusters 

       - Rackham for general purpose computing on CPUs only
       - Snowy available for local projects and suits long jobs (< 1 month) and has GPUs
       - Bianca for sensitive data and has GPUs

   - HPC2N has Kebnekaise with GPUs (and KNLs) 
   - Conda is recommended only for UPPMAX users
    
.. warning:: 

   - At both HPC2N and UPPMAX we call the applications available via the *module system* **modules**. 
   - https://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/software/module-system/ 
   - https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/environment/lmod
   
   To distinguish these modules from the **python** *modules* that work as libraries we refer to the later ones as **packages**.
   
Briefly about the cluster hardware and system at UPPMAX and HPC2N
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**What is a cluster?**

- Login nodes and calculations nodes

- A network of computers, each computer working as a **node**.
     
- Each node contains several processor cores and RAM and a local disk called scratch.

.. figure:: ../img/node.png
   :align: center

- The user logs in to **login nodes**  via Internet through ssh or Thinlinc.

  - Here the file management and lighter data analysis can be performed.

.. figure:: ../img/nodes.png
   :align: center

- The **calculation nodes** have to be used for intense computing.
